    "If you haven't already, you'll need to setup MTurk and AWS accounts that are linked together to use MTurk with Python. The MTurk account will be used to post tasks to the MTurk crowd and the AWS accounts will be used to connect to MTurk via API and provide access to any additional AWS resources that are needed to execute your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you don't have an AWS account already, visit https://aws.amazon.com and create an account you can use for your project.\n",
    "2. If you don't have an MTurk Requester account already, visit https://requester.mturk.com and create a new account.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've setup your accounts, you will need to link them together. When logged into both the root of your AWS account and your MTurk account, visit https://requester.mturk.com/developer to link them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "From your AWS console create a new AWS IAM User or select an existing one you plan to use. Add the AmazonMechanicalTurkFullAccess policy to your user. Then select the Security Credentials tab and create a new Access Key, copy the Access Key and Secret Access Key for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't installed the awscli yet, install it with pip (pip install awscli) and configure a profile using the access key and secret key above (aws configure --profile mturk). \n",
    "\n",
    "To post tasks to MTurk for Workers to complete you will first need to add funds to your account that will be used to reward Workers. Visit https://requester.mturk.com/account to get started with as little as $1.00.\n",
    "\n",

Workers won't work see your tasks in the Sandbox but you can log in to do them yourself to test the task interface at https://workersandbox.mturk.com. It's recommended you test first in the Sandbox to make sure your task returns the data you need before moving to the Production environment. There is no cost to use the Sandbox environment."

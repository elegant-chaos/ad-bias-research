Power Analysis -> Jenn
Presentation Prep (and giving the presentation) -> Jenn
HTML survey design -> Matt 
    -> Thing to be solved: how to get ads randomly inserted when we're showing about 10 
        -> May need to draw random numbers from somewhere else and use them in Mturk
    -> Need to tell Paige and Ricky how the ads should be delivered (in a folder, an excel file, etc.)
        -> Each image will need an ID
Decide demographic questions -> Pooya 
Collect ads and pages -> Ricky and Paige 
    -> Paige: going to office hours to ask if we'd be better off looking at relevance of ads to search
    terms or relevance of ads to specific pages. 
        -> Reminder of professor's words in first meeting: 
        "Google creates training data by showing ads to people with pages and 
        asking if those ads are relevant. Google knows they have biased data 
        (mostly women, mostly in San Diego). We want to investigate if this biased data matters."
        -> Update the problem statement in the slides (slide 2)
    -> Want some political pages (Breitbart, Cheat Sheet, etc.)
    -> Grab using Tor to start as the zero user
    -> Also want some pages for things we have ads for, to put ads on those pages (like a 
    flip the script kind of thing)
    -> One ad per page, 5 pages, 10 ads

This is tentative for the timeline slide (Phase 2):
Be ready to launch MTurk study by Thursday November 14
Collect data Nov 17-23
    -> Pooya will look into how to manage the MTurk study with UMass tool
    -> Ricky will monitor study
Analyze data Nov 24-Dec 5
    -> Jenn and Paige will analyze data
Make poster Dec 6 - Dec 9
    -> Matt (includes data viz)

Agenda:

-> Poster 
    -> Looks good, but needs to be in landscape. Here's a bunch of examples: https://www.makesigns.com/SciPosters_Templates.aspx
-> Data: 
    -> Issues:
        -> about 1/3 data did not have the U.S. criteria, toss this part out (can use this part for gender only)
        -> Pooya will ad column indicating which rows to toss
        -> toss into the data folder in the repo
    -> How to use the cleaning script
        -> You do need to download R to use the cleaning script
    -> Exploratory graphs
        -> Could use some (one or two) really cool graphs for the poster (Jenn, tentative: Paige)
    -> Summary table (Ricky)
        -> how many observations in each category
-> ANOVA Analysis (Jenn)
    -> in R
-> Data cleaning in R
    -> zip code to city, state, region, education level of area (Paige, U.S. Zip Code Python library)
    -> add columns to cleaned data set 
-> Build a machine learning model (Pooya)
    -> 80/20 split, on 80% we train using 5-fold (maybe 10-fold) CV and estimate error that way, hold out that 20% until 
    we pick a final model and run that model on the 20% once only to get out of sample error estimate 
    -> clustering?
    -> small sample size with categorical survey data modeling
    -> can fit some things and play around 
    -> true label is what the people rated, our features are the demo data
        -> groups: non-political to political page, non-political to non-political page (these are features, too)
        -> if you're concerned about the true label being different for two people with identical demographics, 
        you can average the label and then fit on demographics
    -> SVM, logistic regression, knn (maybe?), correlation analysis (principle components, wish list item) 
    -> For Pooya, factors in pandas: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15723628/pandas-make-a-column-dtype-object-or-factor
    -> each person is actually 16 data points 

-> Getting the poster finished 
    -> Everyone writes a section as they complete their work (Jenn, Pooya, Paige, Ricky, Matt)
    -> sections
        -> motivation/introduction (include lit review here)
        -> data, collection (summar table goes here)
        -> ANOVA/analysis of differences
        -> machine learning model
        -> conclusions and recommendations
    -> All sections should be completely written by MIDNIGHT SATURDAY
    -> How do we present these? Do we need to print them?

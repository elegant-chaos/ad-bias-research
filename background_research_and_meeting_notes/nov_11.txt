Power analysis
    -> 30 samples per group (combo of all the relevant features per ad-to-page pairing)

Ad/Page matches
    -> Finalized images will be finished early Wednesday 
    -> Paige and Ricky to meet after class on Tuesday to shore up the work 
    -> Hard to match political pages with political ads
    -> 6 pages each paired with 2 ads each: 2 liberal, 2 conservative, 2 non-political pages each paired with a political and a not political ad
        -> 3 political ads and 3 neutral ads (we need 12 ads)
        -> sees liberal page with relevant (all political ads are relevant to political pages) and not relevant, etc. 
    -> All images need to be the same size when delivered
    -> naming convention: websiteName-adName.png (MTurk people can see this name)
        -> excel file that organizes these by right,left,neutral and relevant/not-relevant 
    
Demographic questions
 -> Jenn will have this work done EOD Wednesday
    -> gender, occupation, education, internet usage?
    -> Jenn dig into this issue this week
        -> zip code not recommended by professor, bc it is kind of a privacy invasion
        -> this is something to be researched 
            -> how does this work with MTurk?
    -> Likert Scale of political affiliation
        -> Makes folks more likely to report when they voted for trump, voted right
    -> race 2-part: 
        -> ethnicity/race
        -> are you of hispanic origin?
    -> Jenn dig into this issue: 
        -> Feelings about ads 
        -> How should we ask this question? Likert scale?

Software to run mturk study
    -> In python, specify duration of study, compensation
    -> Data returned in json file 
        -> someone can work on parsing the json file now
    -> Need credentials for production amazon turk that has money in it
    -> Pilot study:
        -> various groups see the images in different orders
        -> have amazon collect set number of responses for each group
        -> See how long does it take to get the different responses for a small count per group initially
            -> gives us a chance to adjust for compensation

Questionnaire
    -> finish the Questionnaire
        -> test it with a few people that aren't us to see how long it takes
    -> Matt and Pooya will have sample MTurk questionnaire ready to go on Friday morning (10 a.m.)
        -> We will all need MTurk accounts to let people test on 
        -> Set the survey so the same account can do it multiple times 

Timeline for study launch
    -> Need to tell the professor how many responses we want and ask him for the money via e-mail
        -> primary question to base on our numbers on (region?)

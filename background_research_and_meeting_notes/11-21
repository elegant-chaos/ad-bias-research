# Notes from Meeting with Professor:

- Instructions on top - include cost ($.15)

- Cut intro down from 4 sentances (paraphrase). People will not read 4 sentances.

- Consider using a dropdown for relevancy rankings over likert scale

- Number questions

- Make scale same for all questions 

- Consider allowing people to complete it multiple times. It's okay if we determine that we could get stronger demographic results with increased budget in the feature.

- Do pilot for 50-100 people first. It's okay if you make changes afterwards. Eliminate these people from the real study (because you have their IDs)

- If demographics are way off, adjust halfway through and relaunch. Ex. if there are not enough women, require last 100 to be women

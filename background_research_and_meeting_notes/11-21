# Notes from Meeting with Professor:

- Instructions on top - include cost ($.15)

- Cut intro down from 4 sentances (paraphrase). People will not read 4 sentances.
TODO: Jen update instructions 

- Change likert scale to options 

- Number questions
TODO: Matt label questions 

- Make scale same for all questions 

- Consider allowing people to complete it multiple times. It's okay if we determine that we could get stronger demographic results with increased budget in the feature.

- Do pilot for 50-100 people first. It's okay if you make changes afterwards. Eliminate these people from the real study (because you have their IDs)
  (5 hits to be released, can be done by 9 people. Take those ids and don't let them do it again)
  
  - Don't reject anyone just let them do it again 

- If demographics are way off, adjust halfway through and relaunch. Ex. if there are not enough women, require last 100 to be women

- Change hit time to 2 hours (turkers can have multiple tasks at once)

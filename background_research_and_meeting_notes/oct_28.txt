Agenda:

Lit review:
 - Big question: How does previous work on discrimination relate to what we're working on?

Pooya: 
 - Mechanical turk and ad research: 
    - both used specific software 
     - flash to show users one of twenty scenarios randomly
     - browser, mturk users asked users to open ads in their browser
 - User perception of discrimination in online advertising
    - super related 
    - can use this one to model our mturk methodology
    - look in this paper at the number of questions
 - Android phone study
    - checked from user history which ads displayed
 - Big takeaway for Pooya: we can use longer survey 
 - Demographic example: What do online behavioral advertising privacy disclosures communicate to users?
    - See Page 6 Table 1
 - scenario definition: whatever we want to show to users to collect data from them
    - Should have ads that are very related, neutral, and unrelated. 
    - Need to justify why we chose the pages and the ads. 
    - Have control group that is just a benign webpage with ads. 

Paige: 
 - She feels Pooya's found papers are a little more related than what she found.
 - Biggest disconnect:
    - Personal relevance vs. contextual relevance
        - contextual: whether or not the ad relates to the pages
        - personal: whether or not the ad relates to the person 
 - Good paper:
    - Covers the state of online advertising, how the bids work 
    - Name: Online Display Advertising Markets Literature Review and Future Direction 

Ricky: 
 - Acted as a second reader on some of the bib papers. 

Zero-day User:
 - Matt, how did this go? Describe briefly your recommendation. Can you add to the methodology 
 by Wednesday p.m. for folks to review before Thursday?
    - Found a bunch of good resources that only take using a button. We all know that cookies
    are used to track us but there's another method called fingerprinting that takes info about your
    browser and your computer to ID you. Firefox does offer some protection but if we want to take 
    things to the next level, we can use tor. https://www.torproject.org/
    - Pooya suggestion: stay ourselves and visit webpages to collect ads, then we can compare
    - Take-away: After we confirm methodology with prof thursday, we will all collect ads over the 
    weekend.
    - Matt point: We should make sure our ads are from google and not place there by the owner
    - Pooya: we need a control website to collect ads from
    - Work to do: construct list of webpages we're going to visit. 
        - 4chan does have ads and they do have a white power wall
        - everyone look for pages this week and let's construct a list

Methodology:
 - Need to decide how to choose ads/pages
 - Need to decide demographics of interest
 - Both of the above decisions should be literature based. What did everyone read that relates
 to these decisions?
 - questions: 
 - Ask general opinions of advertising to detect relationships with super negative/super positive
 results.
 - Will need to test the survey tool with people we know or whatever to gauge how well the Likert
 questions are working. 

Presentation
 - Pretty simple assignment
 - Need a timeline with tasks for everyone spelled out on it in the slide deck
    - Make next Monday. 
 - Slides are started, find link in your e-mail 

Mechanical Turk:
 - Matt: stoked on the html form 

Meeting with professor:
 - Go over our methodology
 - How are we paying for mechanical turk? (credit card from department or reimbursement)
 


 October 31, 2019

Breitbart has white supremacy ads. 

Notes on the hypothesis:
 - may want to ask if the ads are offensive on their own

Think about showing people 5-10 pages, instead of just 1, to amortize
the demographic questions. 

Ad to Bib: "Inside the Turk: Understanding MTurk as a Participant Pool"

Over the weekend: 
   - Everyone should just skim through the annotated bib
   - On Tuesday, meet in the HUB. On Tuesday, we'll make a plan to collect ads, 
   collect pages, and write up the final methodology. Put Matt on writing HTML for
   the survey and he's off ad collection. Jenn needs to do a power analysis so 
   she's also off collecting ads. 
   - Relax over the weekend because all have midterms.

Questions to Ask


-Paying for study
-Demographics -should we be asking about zip code?

-Are we okay to focus on the political angle?


Can we get more information from what google has researched?
-are they focusing on contextual or personal relevance?
-are they looking at search ads or display ads (embedded in page)
-should we consider effect of keyword matching?

-About ads - should we show context (like CNN.com)

-Is there any other feedback from our presentation today?

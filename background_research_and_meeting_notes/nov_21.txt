Still need to do:

- implement rejection criteria: 
        - zip code should be a real zip code
        - age should be in a reasonable range (greater than min mturk age, less than 100)
        - survey should take longer than 30 seconds
        - reject workers who have already done one of these HITs

- extend amount of time turkers can take (10 minutes too short, some grab and hold a lot of HITs at once)

- probably also need to extend the amount of time HITs stay live for (maybe a few hours? not sure)
